        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          UNEARTHED™ is the 2025-26 FLL Challenge theme, where we explore how tools,
          innovations, and works of art connect us to people and ideas from history.
          Inspired by archaeology, we investigate historical problems and apply modern
          STEM solutions.

        <h3>Robot Game</h3>
        <p>
          Our autonomous LEGO robot completes ~15 missions on a themed field, each tied
          to archaeological tasks. We design, build, and program using SPIKE™ Prime to
          score maximum points through strategic engineering and precise coding.

    <h2>📡 LiDAR Scanning</h2>
    <p>
      Our robot uses <strong>LiDAR sensors</strong> to emit laser rays in multiple
      directions. Each ray measures the distance to nearby obstacles, allowing the
      robot to detect walls even in complete darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This technology is inspired by archaeological cave exploration, where traditional
      light-based vision fails. By mapping the environment through distance measurement,
      we uncover hidden spaces - just like archaeologists uncover history.

    <h2>🧭 Autonomous Navigation</h2>
    <p>
      Based on LiDAR data, our robot calculates optimal paths through complex
      environments. It uses advanced algorithms to detect obstacles, identify free
      space, and make real-time navigation decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our navigation system combines sensor data with pathfinding algorithms,
      allowing the robot to explore unknown territories autonomously - similar to
      how archaeologists systematically explore dig sites.

    <h2>⛏️ Mission Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      In the UNEARTHED™ challenge, our robot must carefully collect artifacts from
      various locations on the field and transport them to designated zones. This
      requires precise positioning, gentle handling, and strategic planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This animation demonstrates one of our key missions: collecting artifacts and
      delivering them to the museum zone. Watch as the robot navigates the field,
      picks up artifacts, and scores points by placing them in the correct location.
