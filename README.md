## 🏛️ UNEARTHED™ Challenge (2025-26)

**"Uncover the past to discover the future"**

This season, we explore how tools, innovations, and works of art connect us to people and ideas from history. Inspired by archaeology, we investigate historical problems and apply modern STEM solutions to preserve and understand our shared heritage.

Our robot completes ~15 missions related to archaeological tasks, from artifact collection to site preservation, scoring points through strategic engineering and precise autonomous programming.
